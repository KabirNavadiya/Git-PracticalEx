# Git-PracticalEX

**Git Exercise:**

Steps Covered
1. Repository Creation
A new repository was created from a template.
2. Git Flow Initialization
Git Flow was initialized to set up structured branching with develop for ongoing work and main for production-ready code.
3. Feature Branch Creation
A feature branch was created following the Zoho task ID naming convention (TP2-T1299_Project_Setup).
4. Sub-Branch and Git Operations
A sub-branch was created from the feature branch to work on specific tasks.
Several Git operations were performed, including:
Squashing multiple commits into one.
Resetting the branch to a specific commit.
Rebasing commits on top of the feature branch.
Cherry-picking specific commits from other branches.
5. Branch from Develop & Commit Hooks
A new branch was created from develop.
A commit message hook was added to enforce consistent commit message guidelines.
6. Pull Request Creation
A small PR was created to merge changes into develop.
For concurrent work, another branch was created from develop, and once the previous PR was merged, the branch was updated and a new PR was created.
7. Versioning & Tagging
Version tags were added to specific commits to track new releases.
8. Readme Changes
Readme modifications were made in two additional branches.
Changes from one branch were cherry-picked into another, with the commit message updated.
Further commits were added to the second branch, and the last commit was deleted.
